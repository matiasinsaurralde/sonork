WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

Full source codes for the Sonork Instant Messenger
that may be downloaded from http://www.sonork.com
V1.5.0.2

================================================
VERY IMPORTANT NOTES (THAT *DO* APPLY TO YOU)
================================================

COMPILERS
---------
Source codes compile on:
Borland C++ 5.0		(project included, folder: BorlandC)
Visual C++ 6.0      (project included, folder: VisualC)

Notes:
Project may be converted to Borland Builder 4.0 with 
the idetobpr.exe utility included in BCB


LICENSE
-------
You MUST read what the Sonork Source Code License says,
which basically is:

A) WHAT YOU CAN DO: Anything you want, without paying 
   royalties nor mentioning us (although that would be nice) 
   nor are you forced to also make your source code open source.

B) WHAT YOU CANNOT DO: Create an Instant Messaging
   SERVER or you'll take me out of business and I
   won't be able to contribute anymore to the C++ community.


EXECUTING THE APPLICATION
-------------------------

Because the installer has not been included,
you will first need to download and install
the messenger from http://www.sonork.com;

Once installed, the run-time registry entries
and folder will be ready and you can use
the executable generated by these source codes.


BORLAND C++ 5.x
---------------

The <commctrl.h> included in Borland C++ 5.x
does not support IE4.0 commons controls.
You will need to obtain an updated version
of it. I cannot include it myself because
of CopyRight notices, but if you have BCB 4.0 
or VCC 6.0, you can use their <commctrl.h>

DEFINITIONS
-----------

These 4 definitions are necesary to compile:
 SONORK_APP_BUILD
 SONORK_CLIENT_BUILD
 SONORK_CODEC_LEVEL=10
 STRICT
They are already defined in the proyect files.

TESTING YOUR SONORK CLIENT
--------------------------

You may use the generated client with the public server
running at server.sonork.com.

All we PLEASE ask is that, if you're going to 
experimentation, download the FREE server and test 
the changes on YOUR server. The production server is 
always busy and is used by a lot of people that 
depend on its speed for working and if you start
using it for tests I will be forced to stop 
distributing the source files.
