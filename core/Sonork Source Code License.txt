VERSION 1
---------

This license is made by SONORK SRL (LICENSOR) , to grant you (LICENSEE), 
permission, free of charge, to obtain a copy of the Sonork Client Source Code 
and associated documentation files and the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, 
publish, distribute and/or sell copies of such Source code and to permit 
persons to whom the source code is furnished to do so.

Definitions 
-----------
"Library" means a collection of software functions and/or data 
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
  programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. 

"Work based on the library" or "derived from it" means either
 the Library itself or any work under copyright law: that is to say, 
 a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or 
 with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
 to it. For a library, the source code includes any associated interface 
 definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
 installation of the library. 

"Sonork Client Source Code" (SCSC) is any source code, library or other program 
  which contains a notice placed by the LICENSOR saying it may be distributed 
  under the terms of this License.

Terms
------
1) If the SCSC derived work is used to produce software for any type of communication, 
   it must remain compatible with the Sonork Messaging System. Compatible meaning, 
   but not limited to, the ability to connect, exchange instant messages, files 
   and see other users online status.
2) SCSC derived work may be able to connect to 3rd party Instant Messaging Servers 
   not owned by the LICENSOR, provided that the functionality expressed in 1 is 
   not degraded by doing so.
3) Code derived from the SCSC cannot be used to create any kind of Server Software 
   without written permission of the LICENSOR. Server Software meaning, but not 
   limited to, applications to which the derived work established a link with 
   in order to function or extend its functions.
4) The LICENSEE may choose to disclose the original SCSC or the derived work. 
   In either case the name of the LICENSOR must appear and any modifications 
   to the original SCSC should be clearly indicated.
5) Neither the name of the LICENSOR nor the names of its contributors may be used 
   to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific 
   prior written permission. 
6) The LICENSEE may not add restrictions on the original SCSC nor to other 
   LICENSEES derived libraries. It may do so for its own derived work.
7) The SCSC may not be used as a tool to disable or attempt to disable Sonork 
   Server Applications which are not owned by You. Testing unstable or potentially 
   harmful versions of the derived work against Servers not owned by You is considered 
   an offense  to this license term. 
8) The SCSC may not be used as a tool to disable or attempt to disable Sonork 
   Client Applications not owned by You. Testing unstable or potentially harmful
   versions of the derived work with other users who have not agreed to do so is
   considered an offense to this license term. 
9) If your redistribute the SCSC, or any part of it, this license, unmodified,
   MUST accompany the SCSC.
